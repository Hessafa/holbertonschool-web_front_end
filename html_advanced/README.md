# Advanced HTML Project

## Overview

This project was completed as part of the **Advanced HTML** module authored by David Dias, Senior Software Engineer at HomeX. The focus was on learning and applying HTML5 to structure a fully semantic, standards-compliant webpage — without any CSS or JavaScript.

All work was done using raw HTML to reinforce best practices in markup, semantic structure, and proper use of tags.

## What I Learned

Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with:

- The basic skeleton of an HTML5 document.
- Semantic tags such as `<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<nav>`, `<aside>`, and `<footer>`.
- The differences between block-level and inline elements (`<div>` vs `<span>`).
- Correct use of heading tags (`<h1>` to `<h6>`) and why hierarchy matters.
- Creating ordered and unordered lists.
- Embedding media: images (`<img>`), videos (`<video>`), audio (`<audio>`).
- Inserting external content using `<iframe>`.
- Structuring tabular data using the `<table>` element and related tags.
- Following W3C validation standards for clean, accessible HTML.

## Project Scope

The project simulates building content for a fictional company called **Techium**, with pages including:

- A home page
- An about/team page
- A services or product listing
- Media integration examples (image, audio, video)
- External embeds (e.g., maps or external pages)

Each page is structured semantically using appropriate tags, with proper indentation and nesting.

## Files Included

- `index.html` – Main landing page
- `about.html` – Team or company profile
- `services.html` – Services or products offered
- `media.html` – Embedded images, video, and audio
- `external.html` – Embedded external content via `<iframe>`
- `README.md` – This documentation file

## Validation

All HTML pages were tested and validated using the [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/) to ensure compliance with HTML5 standards.
